    <section class="history">
      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>From 1956 to 1961, efforts began with the Malayan Library Group proposing the idea of a national library. Between 1962 and 1971, funding and planning were established, and in 1966, the National Library was officially formed. By 1972, the National Library Act was passed, and services expanded. </p>
      <p>During the 1980s, PNM became the national center for ISBN and Malay manuscripts. Over the years, PNM has moved through several buildings before its current location was finalized in Kuala Lumpur. Since 2000, PNM has continued to grow, receiving recognition from UNESCO and adopting digital services.
